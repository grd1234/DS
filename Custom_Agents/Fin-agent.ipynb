    "In the fintech sector, making informed investment decisions involves extensive analysis of multiple data points such as stock performance, market sentiment, financial reports, and macroeconomic trends. This analysis is time-consuming, complex, and requires significant expertise, often leading to missed opportunities or suboptimal investment outcomes. Investors and analysts need a more efficient, accurate, and automated way to navigate this sea of data to make well-informed decisions regarding stock investments—whether to buy, hold, or sell. Fin-Agent solves this problem by automating the process.\n"

    "At the core of the system is **Fin-Agent**, a higher-level agent responsible for analyzing stocks and making buy, sell, or hold recommendations. Fin-Agent uses the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SQL Agent**: Converts natural language queries into SQL commands to extract stock details, fundamentals, ratios, and technicals from a database.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **News Agent**: Generates relevant keywords to fetch company and industry news. It then summarizes the articles for Fin-Agent to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insider Transactions Tool**: Provides data on insider trades, such as executive buy/sell actions, which can influence stock decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Current Stock Data Tool**: Retrieves the latest stock prices, trends, and performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process\n",
    "Fin-Agent assesses individual or organization-owned stocks by using these tools to decide whether to hold or sell. It can also analyze any stock to provide a buy, sell, or hold recommendation.\n"

       "  'title': 'Amid protest by retail associations, big e-commerce players launched yearly mega sales',\n",
       "  'body': 'By Nikhil Dedha\\n\\nNew Delhi [India], September 21 (ANI): Amid protest by retail trade bodies about deep discounts by big e-commerce players like Amazon and Flipkart, all major e-commerce platforms have announced their biggest sales of the year.\\n\\nThe trade bodies have called deep discounts an unethical practice and asked the government to intervene. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) accused them of undermining the country\\'s retail trade ecosystem.\\n\\n\"These discounts are aimed at attracting consumers, they flagrantly violate rules governing fair trade and pricing. Such excessive discounting not only distorts market competition but also creates an uneven playing field, particularly harming smaller retailers and businesses that cannot compete with these deep discounts,\" said B.C. Bhartia, CAIT National President.\\n\\nMajor players in the e-commerce space are ramping up their marketing campaigns and offering significant price cuts to attract consumers during this crucial shopping period.\\n\\nIn an exclusive conversation with ANI, Saurabh Srivastava, Vice President of Categories at Amazon India, expressed the company\\'s enthusiasm for its highly anticipated sale.\\n\\n\"We are super excited about the upcoming Amazon Great Indian Festival. Last year, it was our biggest festival sale ever, and this year we are expecting it to be the biggest ever again. We have 16 lakh sellers and brand partners who are ready with their best offers. Never seen before prices across electronics, mobile, fashion, health, beauty, and grocery. Across all these, we have never seen before offers that these sellers are going to come up with,\" he said.\\n\\nResponding to the questions of small businesses hurting from the big discounts he stated, \"We have always been about enabling sellers, small and medium businesses, women entrepreneurs, karigars, weavers, bringing all of them together and making ensuring that they can reach and reach customers across the country. We have been focused on digitizing them. We have in fact made a pledge. So for example, one of our pledge was that we want to enable from a base of 16 lac seller, we wanted to enable exports for them\".\\n\\nHowever, while customers look forward to the discounts, these strategies have ignited concerns among small trade bodies, which argue that such aggressive pricing tactics negatively impact traditional small businesses.\\n\\nThe small traders and retailers claim that the steep discounts offered by major e-commerce platforms make it difficult for them to compete, as they often lack the resources to match the offers made by large online retailers.\\n\\nAccording to them, while large e-commerce companies benefit from massive sales, small retailers are struggling to maintain their foothold in the market, especially during the festive season when their businesses would traditionally thrive.

       "  'title': \"Ecommerce is making China's deflation worse\",\n",
       "  'body': 'Pinduoduo, popular among Chinese consumers for its discounts, sent \"reminders\" whenever other sellers dropped their prices below hers. When Lin cut her prices, the site would temporarily promote her products-only to warn her a few days later that more reductions were needed for the site to continue driving customers to her goods.When Lin Yunyun started selling diapers two years ago on Pinduoduo, China\\'s fast-growing e-commerce site, she was not prepared for the relentless nagging about prices.\\n\\nPinduoduo, popular among Chinese consumers for its discounts, sent \"reminders\" whenever other sellers dropped their prices below hers. When Lin cut her prices, the site would temporarily promote her products-only to warn her a few days later that more reductions were needed for the site to continue driving customers to her goods.\\n\\n\"The platform keeps reminding me to lower prices,\" said Lin, 28, who lives in Zhangzhou, a city in southeastern China.\\n\\n\"If I cut my price any more, I won\\'t make any money.\"\\n\\nNo company embodies China\\'s deflationary moment quite like Pinduoduo. Shoppers flock to the app for its staggering discounts, the result of its push to lower prices.\\n\\nAs the country\\'s second-largest online retailer, it is the shopping destination of choice for those who embrace so-called downgraded spending-a social-media fueled maxim of Chinese consumers\\' penny-pinching ways.\\n\\nRattled by a real estate crisis with no end in sight and a faltering labour market, Chinese consumers are spending less and saving more. Prices are falling, and profits are shrinking. Companies are hesitant to hire more workers or invest in the future, fuelling even more concerns about the economy.\\n\\nAfter some half measures that failed to reinvigorate the economy, Beijing has finally signalled that it is ready to take more aggressive action, although it\\'s unclear how far it is willing to go. Late last month, the government announced interest rate cuts and other initiatives to revive the property market, as well as steps to prop up stock markets.\\n\\nAnd despite hints of additional fiscal spending to put more money into the hands of Chinese consumers, the government has not revealed any specific plans. Rhodium Group, a research firm, said in a note that policymakers had demonstrated more willingness to act on the economy, but deflationary pressures were among several important issues that remained unresolved.\\n\\nChina\\'s gross domestic product deflator, an economic indicator that measures prices broadly across the economy, has contracted for five straight quarters, the longest downturn in a quarter century. Ultimately, this means that the economy may not be growing as fast as the main GDP figure - targeted by Beijing to increase by about 5% this year - would suggest.\\n\\nThe government had directed most of its policy focus on supporting production and investment. While this has kept Chinese factories humming, it has left the country and its global trading partners awash in excess goods. An abundance of supply is helping to keep prices low.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s where Pinduoduo comes in. Because a growing portion of spending in China is happening online, price reductions by the app and other e-commerce platforms copying its success have contributed to a deflationary downturn. About 60% of the country\\'s consumers buy through e-commerce, accounting for more than one-third of all retail spending, according to HSBC. \"Pinduoduo is both the consequence and cause of deflation,\" said Donald Low, a professor of practice in public policy at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\\n\\nFounded in 2015, Pinduoduo has grown more quickly than its more established rivals, recently expanding abroad with its Temu brand. In its most recent quarter, Pinduoduo said revenue had risen 86%. It warned, however, that future profits might take a hit because it planned to invest heavily to support \"high-quality\" merchants.\\n\\nColin Huang, Pinduoduo\\'s founder and one of China\\'s richest men, has said that one of the company\\'s core values is not to sell cheap products, but to offer goods that customers will feel are less expensive than they should be.\\n\\nThis year, Lin said Pinduoduo had enrolled her in an \"automated price tracking system\" to allow the company to lower the price of her diapers whenever it detected similar products available for less. A few months after she opted out of the program, she discovered that the setting had been turned on again.\\n\\nPinduoduo, which did not respond to requests for comment for this article, has said that this feature helps to improve the \"operating efficiency\" of merchants, while providing customers with more competitively priced products.\\n\\nEconomists have studied the consequences of e-commerce on pricing for years.\\n\\nIn the mid-2010s, economists started citing something called the Amazon Effect, for the influence wielded by the dominant online retailer Amazon.com to drive down prices across the web and at brick-and-mortar stores. Almost all retailers, including Amazon, track each other\\'s prices and then adjust their own using so-called dynamic pricing, when prices move according to market conditions.\\n\\nThe conventional thinking was that the Amazon Effect helped to keep prices down. But Alberto Cavallo, a professor at Harvard Business School, argued in 2018 that e-commerce was making prices more sensitive to economic shocks, such as higher energy costs.\\n\\nCavallo said China might be experiencing something similar but in the opposite direction. The economic shock of a slumping economy is applying downward pricing pressure, and the effect is being accelerated by e-commerce platforms.\\n\\nPinduoduo\\'s success has prompted its two largest rivals, Alibaba and JD.com, to join the low-price competition. Last year, Alibaba\\'s Taobao started a campaign to rate sellers based on how their prices compared to other e-commerce platforms, according to Chinese media. The sellers with better prices would receive more traffic and exposure for their products. JD.com, once known for selling high-end electronics, has also created a series of low-price campaigns.\\n\\nZhang Zhuo, a Chinese journalist, wrote a post titled \"The Better Pinduoduo Is, the Worse the Times Are.\" In the article, which has been removed from WeChat, China\\'s dominant messaging app, she said Pinduoduo has conditioned shoppers to ignore brands and look for the cheapest options.\\n\\nOnline merchants, Zhang wrote, \"have only two choices, either lower price or sacrifice sales.\"\\n\\nOne shopper on Pinduoduo, Gao Ning, an office administrator in Beijing, said he had initially been wary of using the platform but found it to be a convenient way to buy groceries. Now, he also purchases toilet paper, garbage bags, trash cans, dish soap and cat food from the site.\\n\\n\"Pinduoduo is still a little cheaper,\" he said. He found that the same items were less expensive there than on other sites, because \"everyone goes there expecting good value for money.\"',\n",

       "  'title': 'Firan Technology Group Corporation (\"FTG\") Announces Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results',\n",
       "  'body': 'Third quarter bookings of $45.9M were up 29% over Q3 2023. Third quarter revenues of $43.1M were up 18% over Q3 2023. FTG achieved Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 2024 of $7.2M, which was up 45% over Q3 2023. FTG achieved Net Earnings in Q3 2024 of $2.8M, which was up 109% over Q3 2023.\\n\\nIn Q3 2024, FTG once again had strong bookings because of increasing demand from all segments of the Aerospace and Defence market. This, combined with strong operating performance and continued progress in integrating last year\\'s acquisitions, resulted in the Corporation achieving its best-ever quarterly financial results for revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Earnings, and also strong cash flow from operating activities.\\n\\nDuring Q3 2024, the Corporation has continued to invest in technology in existing sites, grow the business organically, and integrate the two acquisitions completed last year. FTG is strategically deploying its capital in ways that will drive increased shareholder returns for the future in both the near term and long term. Specifically, FTG accomplished the following in Q3 2024, which continues to improve the Company and position it for the future:\\n\\nTable 1 / Key Financial Metrics\\n\\n(1) Adjusted Net Earnings is not a measure recognized under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Management believes that this measure is important to many of the Corporation\\'s shareholders, creditors and other stakeholders. The Corporation\\'s method of calculating Adjusted Net Earnings may differ from other corporations and accordingly may not be comparable to measures used by other corporations.\\n\\nFTG\\'s sales increased by $6.5M, or 17.7%, from $36.6M in Q3 2023 to $43.1M in Q3 2024. The revenue increase in Q3 2024 was driven by organic growth, including an increase in Simulator products sales of $1.2M, and favourable foreign exchange rates. Year-to-date, sales have increased by $21.6M, or 22.7%, compared to year-to-date 2023. Year-to-date sales growth was driven by the acquisitions and organic growth, partially offset by lower simulator product sales and the strike at Aerospace Toronto in Q1 2024.\\n\\nThe Circuits segment sales in Q3 2024 were up $3.6M, or 13.3%, compared to last year as a result of strong customer demand and improved throughput. On a year-to-date basis, the Circuits segment sales were up $22.3M, or 34.9%, with $16.9M from acquisitions and $5.4M of organic growth. Circuits sites in Minnetonka and Haverhill were acquired in April 2023, and year-to-date 2024 includes nine months of operating results for these sites, as compared to four months in 2023 year-to-date results.\\n\\nFor the Aerospace segment, sales in Q3 2024 increased by $3.4M, or 34.2%, compared to last year, due to a $1.2M increase in Simulator products sales and a $2.2M increase in other organic sales. On a year-to-date basis, Aerospace segment sales decreased by $0.3M, or 0.8%. This decrease was primarily due to a $6.3M drop in year-to-date Simulator product sales and a $3.0M impact from the Aerospace Toronto strike in Q1 24, which was partially offset by $9.0M in organic growth.\\n\\nGross margin in Q3 2024 was $11.6M, or 27.0%, as compared to $8.8M, or 24.0%, in Q3 2023. The increase in gross margin dollars and the gross margin rate primarily stems from higher sales volumes and operational improvements across FTG\\'s operations. For the year-to-date period, the gross margin rate excluding government assistance is 26.8% for 2024, as compared to 26.7% for 2023. Factors increasing the gross margin rate include leverage from higher sales volumes and productivity improvements, while factors decreasing the gross margin rate include the decrease in sales of Simulator products, which is cyclical in nature, and the strike at Aerospace Toronto in Q1 2024.\\n\\nNet earnings after tax at FTG in Q3 2024 was $2.8M or $0.11 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $1.3M or $0.05 per diluted share in Q3 2023. The $1.4M increase in net earnings is the result of both higher sales volume and operational improvements. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted net earnings was $6.4M or $0.26 per diluted share compared to adjusted net earnings of $4.7M or $0.19 per diluted share in the prior year period, with the most significant adjustment being the exclusion of Government support in the 2023 results. The increase in adjusted net earnings for the year-to-date period is inclusive of the negative impacts of the decrease in Simulator products sales and the strike at Aerospace Toronto.\\n\\nThe Circuits segment earnings before interest and income taxes (\"EBIT\") was $3.5M in Q3 2024 as compared to $2.2M in Q3 2023. The increase in Circuits segment EBIT is primarily driven by higher sales volume and operational improvements. Year-to-date, Circuits segment EBIT was $8.8M as compared to $7.6M in 2023. Excluding the $2.8M of government assistance in 2023, Circuits segment EBIT increased by $4.0M.\\n\\nThe Aerospace segment EBIT was $2.4M in Q3 2024 versus $1.6M in Q3 2023. The increase in earnings was driven by the increase in sales. Year-to-date, Aerospace segment EBIT was $5.8M as compared to $6.7M in 2023 with sales being relatively flat. Excluding $1.0M of government assistance in 2023, Aerospace segment EBIT was up $0.1M. Aerospace segment EBIT in 2024 has been negatively impacted by lower Simulator revenue and the strike in Q1 2024 at Aerospace Toronto.\\n\\nTable 2 / EBITDA\\n\\n(1) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures recognized under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Management believes that these measures are important to many of the Corporation\\'s shareholders, creditors and other stakeholders. The Corporation\\'s method of calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from other corporations and accordingly may not be comparable to measures used by other corporations.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA for Q3 2024 was $7.2M or 16.7% of sales, as compared to $5.0M or 13.6% of sales in Q3 2023. The increase in profitability is driven by increased operating leverage from higher sales and operational improvements across FTG\\'s operations. For the trailing twelve months period ended August 30, 2024, adjusted EBITDA was $24.2M or 16.1% of sales as compared to $19.4M or 14.3% of sales for the full year 2023.\\n\\nAs at August 30, 2024, the Corporation\\'s net working capital was $47.8M, compared to $41.0M at year-end in 2023.\\n\\nCash flow from operating activities in Q3 2024 was $5.3M as compared to $3.5M in Q3 2023 primarily due to higher net earnings. Cash used for lease liability payments was $1.0M in Q3 2024 as compared to $0.9M in Q3 2023. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $10.0M in 2024 as compared to $7.3M in the same period in 2023. Excluding $3.8M of Employee Retention Credit included in the year-to-date period in 2023, year-to-date cash flow from operating activities increased by $6.5M.\\n\\nNet debt at the end of Q3 2024 was $2.2M compared to net debt of $3.6M at the end of 2023. During the quarter, the Corporation paid the holdback on the IMI acquisition of $0.4M. In addition, FTG has access to committed credit lines of approximately $23.8M.\\n\\nThe Corporation will host a live conference call on Wednesday, October 9, 2024, at 4:00pm (Eastern) to discuss the results of Q3 2024.\\n\\nAnyone wishing to participate in the call should dial 1-289-514-5100 or 1-800-717-1738, Conference ID 24844, and identify that you are calling to participate in the FTG conference call.

The stock generated average annual returns of 20% from 1965 through 2023, doubling the S&P 500\\'s 10% returns.\\n\\nBuffett, influenced by his partner Charlie Munger, has gone from looking for fair companies at great prices to looking for great companies at fair prices. (Munger died in November 2023.)\\n\\nThe Oracle of Omaha (Buffett\\'s hometown) has become the country\\'s most trusted spokesman for the stock market and economy. During the financial crisis of 2007-09, his reassurance to the public that all would be okay likely played a role in calming things down.\\n\\nBerkshire has a hefty stock portfolio. Among recent trades, it halved its stake in Apple (AAPL) , to $91 billion, and unloaded $5.4 billion of Bank of America (BAC) .\\n\\nBerkshire shares have soared 30% year to date, easily topping the S&P 500\\'s 17% gain. Strong performance by Berkshire\\'s insurance companies helped spark the gains, as has appreciation of the company\\'s stock positions.\\n\\nThe economy\\'s resilience also has played a role, as many of Berkshire\\'s subsidiaries depend on the economy\\'s strength. One example is BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) Railway.\\n\\nMany analysts and investors are bullish on Berkshire, including Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. He assigns Berkshire a wide moat, meaning he sees it with competitive advantages that will last at least 20 years.\\n\\nRelated: Warren Buffett\\'s Berkshire sheds stock of major bank\\n\\nTo be sure, he thinks it\\'s pricey now, trading at $462, compared with his fair value estimate of $427.\\n\\n\"We believe that Berkshire, owing to its diversification and its lower overall risk profile, offers one of the better risk-adjusted return profiles in the financial-services sector,\" he wrote in a commentary. \"It\\'s a generally solid candidate for protection during market selloffs.\"\\n\\nWarren is impressed with Berkshire\\'s consistent ability to generate high-single- to double-digit growth in book value per share, comfortably above his estimate of its cost of capital.\\n\\nPearls of Buffett\\'s wisdom\\n\\nInvestors eagerly await Buffett\\'s annual letter to shareholders for its investment wisdom. His latest missive was released Feb. 24.\\n\\nBerkshire had $277 billion in cash as of June 30, and it\\'s not easy to deploy that money in a meaningful way (buying other companies), given Berkshire\\'s huge size, Buffett wrote in the letter.\\n\\nRelated: What Buffett\\'s huge Apple sale really means\\n\\n\"There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others,\" he said.\\n\\nHe also cited a good equation for investment success: \"Thanks to the American tailwind and the power of compound interest, the arena in which we operate has been - and will be - rewarding if you make a couple of good decisions during a lifetime and avoid serious mistakes.\"\\n\\nBerkshire is now a $1 trillion company\\n\\nOne proof of that success for Berkshire and Buffett is the milestone alluded to above: Berkshire crossed the $1 trillion threshold for market capitalization on Wednesday.\\n\\nThat puts it in select company. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Nvidia are the others. And you probably already noticed what sets Berkshire apart from this select six: It\\'s not a technology company.\\n\\nExpert Interviews:\\n\\nOf course, Berkshire does own the $91 billion stake in Apple and $2.3 billion of Internet domain registry Verisign. But Berkshire\\'s operating subsidiaries are generally old-economy companies, such as See\\'s Candies and Geico insurance.\\n\\nObviously the megacap tech companies have grown more quickly than Berkshire. Alphabet began as Google in 1998 and reached $1 trillion in market cap in many fewer years than Berkshire (22 versus 59 years).\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see if Berkshire dives further into tech after Buffett, who turns 94 on Aug. 30, passes. In May 2021 Buffett said that a top deputy of his at Berkshire, Greg Abel, who now is 62, would succeed him.\\n\\nThe author of this story owns shares of Alphabet, Apple and Bank of America.\\n\\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks', 'source': {'uri': 'islandpacket.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Island Packet'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'dan_weil@islandpacket.com', 'name': 'Dan Weil', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/wdtk66/picture291794215/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/7f60f50e-7da0-4ec6-8492-7b12f3260b98', 'eventUri': 'eng-9865864', 'sentiment': 0.2313725490196079, 'wgt': 249, 'relevance': 55}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m\n",

The economic realities of immigration, however, are far more complex than the negative sound bites suggest.\\n\\nFar from being a burden, as critics claim, immigrants play pivotal roles in driving innovation, enhancing productivity and fostering economic growth in their adopted countries. They also elevate their adopted and origin countries\\' standings in global value chains, contributing to economic resilience.\\n\\nWe are economists who study global trade and migration, and our recent work reveals that immigrants contribute far more to the economic fabric of nations than previously understood.\\n\\nBy facilitating what\\'s known as \"trade in value added,\" or TiVA, immigrants play a crucial role in helping countries specialize their production, move up the value chain and significantly enhance trade sophistication.\\n\\nMoving up the value chain means progressing from producing basic, low-value goods to more complex, higher-value products. This shift involves improving skills, technology and production techniques, allowing a country to capture more economic value and develop advanced industries.\\n\\nSo, what exactly is trade in value added, and why is it important?\\n\\nIn today\\'s global economy, products are rarely made entirely in one country. Instead, different stages of production occur across multiple nations. TiVA measures each country\\'s contribution to a final product, providing clearer insight into global value chains. For instance, while an iPhone may be assembled in China, its components come from various countries, each adding value.\\n\\nOur study found that a 10% increase in immigrants from a particular country residing in one of the 38 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states leads to a 2.08% increase in the value added from their home country that becomes embedded in their host country\\'s exports to the world.\\n\\nThis effect was strongest in the services sector, followed closely by agriculture and manufacturing.\\n\\nTo understand how this works, consider Indian software engineers in Silicon Valley. Their understanding of the U.S. tech industry and India\\'s IT sector can lead to partnerships. These partnerships lead to Indian firms providing specialized coding services for American tech giants. The result? Higher-value U.S. tech exports that incorporate Indian expertise. This perfectly illustrates how immigrants boost trade in value added.\\n\\nOr take Chinese immigrants in Italy\\'s fashion industry. Their cultural knowledge might help Italian luxury brands tailor products for the Chinese market and connect Italian designers with highly skilled textile workers in China. The result? Italian fashion exports incorporate Chinese craftsmanship, elevating both countries\\' global fashion value chain positions.\\n\\nOur findings show that immigrants are pivotal bridges in global trade networks. They leverage their unique knowledge, skills and connections to strengthen economic bonds between nations. That\\'s in line with previous research showing the significant role immigrants play in fostering bilateral trade.\\n\\nIn an era of increasing skepticism toward globalization and migration, understanding the positive economic impacts of immigration is crucial. Our current and previous research, and the findings from related studies, indicate that rather than \"stealing jobs,\" immigrants often create value and new economic opportunities that might not otherwise exist.\\n\\nImmigrants bring diverse skills, knowledge and networks to their host countries that can enhance innovation, fill labor shortages and open new market opportunities. They often possess unique insights into their home country markets, helping host country firms navigate cultural nuances and business practices that might otherwise pose trade barriers.\\n\\nFor home countries, emigrants can serve as cultural ambassadors, creating awareness, showcasing products and services, and helping to integrate their homeland into global value chains. They may also contribute to knowledge transfer, investment flows and business connections that boost their home and host countries\\' economic development.\\n\\nMoreover, immigrants\\' ability to enhance trade in value added suggests they play a role in moving countries up the economic value chain. Rather than simply facilitating trade in raw materials or essential manufactured goods, immigrants appear to boost trade in more sophisticated, higher-value products and services. This is crucial for economic development, as countries that position themselves higher in global value chains tend to see bigger benefits.\\n\\nOur observations have important implications for both immigration and trade. For one, they suggest that restrictive immigration policies might have unintended consequences, hindering a country\\'s trade performance and position in global value chains. Countries that want to become more economically competitive might consider more open immigration policies.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, our research indicates that immigrants\\' economic benefits extend beyond the often-cited labor-market and fiscal impacts - in other words, having more workers who pay more taxes.\\n\\nThe evidence suggests policymakers should take a more holistic view of immigration\\'s economic effects, considering its role in facilitating sophisticated international trade and value creation.\\n\\nOur results also align with previous research highlighting the potential value of workforce diversity for businesses, particularly for firms engaged in international trade. Employees from diverse national backgrounds can bring valuable insights and connections that help their companies navigate global markets and value chains.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that immigrants\\' impact on trade in value added varies across countries and sectors. This suggests that rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, targeted policies might most effectively leverage immigration for economic benefit.\\n\\nMaximizing immigration\\'s positive impacts on trade and value chains also requires supportive policies and institutions that allow immigrants to use their skills and networks fully. These might include programs to assist with economic integration, language training, credential recognition and support for immigrant entrepreneurship.\\n\\nAs the global economy continues to evolve, with value chains becoming ever more complex and interconnected, the role of immigrants as facilitators of trade and value creation is likely to grow even more significant. Countries that recognize and leverage this potential stand to gain a competitive edge in the global marketplace.\\n\\nOur research paints a picture of immigrants not as economic burdens but as valuable assets who enhance their host and home countries\\' positions in the global economy. By making sophisticated trade linkages possible, and by boosting participation in global value chains, immigrants contribute to economic growth and development in ways that go far beyond conventional understanding.\\n\\nAs debates around immigration continue, it\\'s crucial to move beyond simplistic narratives and recognize the complex and often subtle ways that immigrants contribute to prosperity.

Tech\\'s thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\\n\\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\\n\\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favour since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union\\'s financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct. There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\\n\\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia.\\n\\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\\n\\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\\n\\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\\n\\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\\n\\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\\n\\nBIG SHIFT\\n\\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\\n\\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfil that,\" he said.\\n\\nNordea\\'s 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\\n\\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley\\'s Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use. Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\\n\\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\\n\\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\\n\\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment. Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nA CHALLENGE\\n\\nThe challenge of increased demand for computing power and data centres is not lost on tech companies.\\n\\nMicrosoft, for example, said its supply chain emissions increased 30.9% in 2023, and Alphabet reported a 13% rise in total emissions, citing power and materials needs for data centers. Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\\n\\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\\n\\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert\\'s Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future. AI proponents say the technology could eventually help make other sectors more energy efficient.\\n\\nOne sign the companies are trying to power the boom with low-carbon energy is increasing investment in nuclear.\\n\\nAmazon said this year it was starting to buy nuclear power to supplement renewables. And Microsoft said last week it had signed a deal to help resurrect a mothballed nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in the first restart of its kind in history.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which offers two Article 9 funds that track indexes with Google and Microsoft among their top five holdings, said improving sustainability data is making it easier to identify where portfolios need adjusting.\\n\\nThe Article 9 funds are built with the aim of showing a 7% average reduction in carbon emissions from all the constituent stocks combined every year, \"which means that over time companies that increase their carbon emissions will likely receive a lower weight in the fund,\" said Aurora Samuelsson, head of sustainability at Handelsbanken Asset Management.\\n\\n\"We raise and will raise the relevant and material issues in our dialogue with the companies,\" Samuelsson said.\\n\\n(Reporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Anna Driver)', 'source': {'uri': 'usnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'U.S. News & World Report'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/74643e6/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fe0%2F354d86967fe6510f4b973a20e5ef3c%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK8P0CG%3A12024-09-26T100406Z_1_LYNXMPEK8P0CG_RTROPTP_3_CLIMATE-TECH-INVESTING.JPG', 'eventUri': 'eng-9942552', 'sentiment': 0.411764705882353, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 10}, {'uri': '8328248928', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-09-19', 'time': '14:01:43', 'dateTime': '2024-09-19T14:01:43Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-09-19T14:01:27Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9921568632125854, 'url': 'https://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/immigrants-are-unsung-heroes-of-global-trade-and-value-creation-research-finds', 'title': 'Immigrants Are Unsung Heroes Of Global Trade And Value Creation, Research Finds', 'body': 'This article is part of TPM Cafe, TPM\\'s home for opinion and news analysis.

Tech\\'s thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\\n\\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\\n\\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favor since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union\\'s financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct. There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\\n\\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple , Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft , Meta and Nvidia.\\n\\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\\n\\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\\n\\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\\n\\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\\n\\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\\n\\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\\n\\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfill that,\" he said.\\n\\nNordea\\'s 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\\n\\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley\\'s Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use. Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\\n\\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\\n\\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\\n\\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment. Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe challenge of increased demand for computing power and data centers is not lost on tech companies.\\n\\nMicrosoft, for example, said its supply chain emissions increased 30.9% in 2023, and Alphabet reported a 13% rise in total emissions, citing power and materials needs for data centers. Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\\n\\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\\n\\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert\\'s Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future. AI proponents say the technology could eventually help make other sectors more energy efficient.\\n\\nOne sign the companies are trying to power the boom with low-carbon energy is increasing investment in nuclear.\\n\\nAmazon said this year it was starting to buy nuclear power to supplement renewables. And Microsoft said last week it had signed a deal to help resurrect a mothballed nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in the first restart of its kind in history.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which offers two Article 9 funds that track indexes with Google and Microsoft among their top five holdings, said improving sustainability data is making it easier to identify where portfolios need adjusting.\\n\\nThe Article 9 funds are built with the aim of showing a 7% average reduction in carbon emissions from all the constituent stocks combined every year, \"which means that over time companies that increase their carbon emissions will likely receive a lower weight in the fund,\" said Aurora Samuelsson, head of sustainability at Handelsbanken Asset Management.\\n\\n\"We raise and will raise the relevant and material issues in our dialog with the companies,\" Samuelsson said.', 'source': {'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/NQ5SG4BYINBYJFPK4PPY3EZQUQ.JPG?auth=0da023a9286141194eb8d8e2d8dbb4d1fa3eacb975f4064037f26b6576ed6c7a&width=560&quality=80', 'eventUri': 'eng-9942552', 'sentiment': 0.4352941176470588, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 26}, {'uri': '2024-09-488834593', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-09-18', 'time': '11:04:12', 'dateTime': '2024-09-18T11:04:12Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-09-18T10:34:43Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9921568632125854, 'url': 'https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/rachel-reeves-commits-improving-women-103443912.html', 'title': \"Rachel Reeves commits to improving women's lives by closing gender pay gap\", 'body': 'Rachel Reeves has said she intends to use her position as the first female Chancellor to \"improve life for women\", as she set out plans to support women in business.\\n\\nMs Reeves said it is a \"huge responsibility\" to head the Treasury and she is aiming to close the gender pay gap, strengthen rights at work and invest in childcare.\\n\\nAnnouncing the Government\\'s support for the Invest in Women Taskforce, which aims to increase investment funding pools for female founders, the Chancellor vowed to improve the economic opportunities available to women.\\n\\nThe taskforce is aiming to create a funding pool of more than £250 million for female-founded businesses through private capital, making it one of the world\\'s largest investment funding pools aimed solely at female founders.\\n\\nThe Rose Review, an independent review of female entrepreneurship led by Dame Alison Rose, found that if the UK were to have the same share of female entrepreneurs as similar countries, £200 billion of value would be added to the economy.\\n\\nMs Reeves is expected to take an active role in steering the taskforce\\'s priorities and objectives.\\n\\nShe said: \"It is a huge responsibility to sit in the Treasury as the first female Chancellor of the Exchequer and be able to use my position to improve life for women across the UK - one that I don\\'t take lightly.\\n\\n\"That includes ending the gender pay gap, strengthening rights at work and investing in childcare.\\n\\n\"And by backing the Invest in Women Taskforce we can establish one of the world\\'s largest dedicated investment funding pools for female-powered businesses, helping grow our economy.\\n\\n\"This event gathers together some very powerful women, but the truth is everyone can do something for women\\'s equality - whether that\\'s supporting the women and girls in their lives with their ambitions or making their workplace a fairer playing field.\"\\n\\nOn Wednesday, which is International Equal Pay Day, the Chancellor is hosting a reception in Number 11 Downing Street for female business leaders from various sectors, such as financial services, technology and the creative industry.', 'source': {'uri': 'uk.finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

But four weeks on from the worst volatility blowup since the pandemic, August will go down as another grand gesture of confidence by Wall Street in its ability to suss out the future.\\n\\nLevels of conviction are soaring across assets. In one example, exchange-traded funds tracking government debt, corporate credit and equities have now risen in unison for four straight months. It\\'s the longest stretch of correlated gains since at least 2007. Up 25% in the past 12 months, the S&P 500 has never climbed this much in the run-up to the first interest-rate cut of an easing cycle, seven decades of data compiled by Ned Davis Research and Bloomberg show.\\n\\nTraders are leaning into bets with zeal even as serious questions linger about the economy and inflation -- and how central bankers will respond. Before the Federal Reserve has even begun to act, bond markets have priced in a slew of rate cuts, measures of default risk are falling and surging equities reflect sure-thing bets the economy will boom.\\n\\nGains of 2.3% for the S&P 500 in August, 1.8% for an ETF tracking long-dated Treasuries and 1.5% for investment-grade bonds all amount to a big show of force by cross-asset bulls, who are convinced Fed Chair Jerome Powell will cut rates into a healthy economy. All told, the wagers are at the mercy of how economic data -- capricious of late -- plays out on the cusp of the central bank\\'s meeting on Sept. 18.\\n\\n\"Everything has to go right,\" said Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"We need to continue to have trend or above trend economic growth. We need to have a labor market that\\'s not too hot, not too cold. And that then would allow for the consumer to continue to consume. Those things all have to be in a perfect balance.\"\\n\\nWhile markets have righted themselves, the travails of early August demonstrate the delicacy of the present consensus, with a single government report -- US hiring data for July -- fueling convulsions that briefly sent Wall Street\\'s fear gauge, the VIX, above 65. August\\'s employment update is just seven days away -- with economist forecasts compiled by Bloomberg putting payroll additions anywhere from 100,000 to 208,000.\\n\\nData on US manufacturing, durable-goods orders and initial jobless claims are also due next week, each with the potential to influence sentiment at a time when growth has become a singular obsession of markets. At Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last week, Powell said \"the direction of travel is clear\" on future policy, but that \"the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.\"\\n\\nFed dovishness was instrumental in pulling Wall Street\\'s investment complex through its summer tantrum, with the flash crash in early August quickly consigned to history. All four major asset ETFs (tickers: SPY, TLT, LQD, HYG) rose at least 1% for the month while more than $1 trillion was added to American equities alone.\\n\\nTraders are pouncing on everything from small-cap stocks to speculative debt convinced that the world\\'s largest economy will avoid a consumer-led downturn despite a weakening labor market. Funds focused on US stocks added $5.8 billion for a ninth straight week of inflows and those specialized in high yield attracted $1.7 billion, EPFR Global data compiled by Bank of America Corp. show.\\n\\nFor now at least, nothing in economic data or corporate earnings is screaming danger. Yet if there is a lesson in August\\'s rout, it\\'s that consensus bets -- going long artificial intelligence, exploiting the weakening yen -- can backfire suddenly.\\n\\nFor a sense of the tenuousness, consider the path of rate cuts priced in Fed fund futures. Back in January, when inflation fears ebbed, bond traders wagered on roughly six rate reductions for all of 2024, with the first one arriving as early as March. When inflation proved stickier than forecast, those bets were pared and by April, only one cut was expected.\\n\\nNow the consensus is, the Fed will kick off its easing cycle next month, with four quarter-point reductions by December.\\n\\n\"The reality is both the Fed\\'s own guess in the dot plot and the market\\'s expectations are always wrong,\" said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management. \"I could see easily three cuts this year. Four might sound pretty extreme. It would probably only happen if the economy was really in bad shape.\"\\n\\nAt the same time, caution has mostly proved a costly investment philosophy this year. In the credit market, the much dreaded maturity wall -- the threat of painful refinancings by corporate borrowers at higher rates -- is collapsing as the amount of looming debt repayments in the junk bond market is poised for the biggest annual decline in at least a decade. Credit default swaps, or instruments designed to hedge exposure to credit risks, have retreated as the Markit CDX North American High Yield Index hovered near the lowest levels since early 2022.\\n\\nRather than taking a hit from higher borrowing costs as many had feared, corporate earnings may in fact have benefited from the jump in benchmark rates from 0% to over 5%. That allowed cash-rich firms, technology megacaps in particular, to enjoy a steady stream of income from their bond investments.\\n\\nAccording to Kaixian Tan, an analyst at Gavekal Research, the entire increase in non-financial corporate income since 2022 can be attributed to a drop in interest payments on a net basis -- a counterintuitive situation where booming interest income broadly offset rising debt service costs as rates rose. Now with interest rates heading lower, that tailwind is under threat.\\n\\n\"Rate cuts will squeeze corporates\\' interest income, and therefore their profits,\" Tan wrote in a note this week. \"This will disproportionately hit big companies sitting on large cash mountains, and may lead to their relative underperformance.\"\\n\\nTo Jack McIntyre, global bond portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, predicting anything in the post-pandemic world is nearly futile. If he had to venture a guess, it\\'s that economic resilience will dull in the coming year and in that environment, bonds will beat stocks.\\n\\n\"To me, a soft landing is just a hard landing postponed,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think we go from soft landing back to a no landing.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'economictimes.indiatimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Economic Times'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112939943,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-375650,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9864779', 'sentiment': 0.02745098039215677, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 26}, {'uri': '8328011684', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-09-19', 'time': '11:22:25', 'dateTime': '2024-09-19T11:22:25Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-09-19T11:21:55Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9921568632125854, 'url': 'https://santamariatimes.com/ap/national/critical-defect-rate-rises-to-1-58-per-aces-mortgage-qc-industry-trends-report/article_7c3c1914-b761-528a-b7cd-c9eb4e0bce6e.html', 'title': 'Critical Defect Rate Rises to 1.58%, Per ACES Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report', 'body': '- This modest defect rate increase ends a five-quarter downward trend -\\n\\nDENVER, Colo., Sept. 19, 2024 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) -- ACES Quality Management® (ACES), the leading provider of enterprise quality management and control software for the financial services industry, announced the release of its quarterly ACES Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report covering the first quarter (Q1) of 2024. The latest report analyzes post-closing quality control data derived from ACES Quality Management & Control® software.\\n\\nNotable findings from the Q1 2024 report include the following:\\n\\nThe overall critical defect rate increased 3.27% to 1.58% in Q1 2024, ending five quarters of decline.While Income/Employment remains the leading category of defects, performance improved tremendously quarter-over-quarter in this category.Defects increased in two of the four major underwriting categories, with Credit defects nearly doubling from Q4 2023.Legal/Regulatory/Compliance defects increased by 208.37% to 16.22%, becoming the second-highest category of defects this quarter, followed by Loan Documentation at 14.41%.Insurance defects, while usually negligible, comprised 8.11% of all defects.Although refinance review share declined this quarter, defect share doubled, indicating a degradation in quality in this area.Defect share outstripped review share for conventional loans this quarter, most certainly fueled by the surge in refinance defects.Both review share and defect share declined in the FHA category. Lenders also saw substantial improvements in VA defect share despite significantly increasing review share over Q4.\\n\\n\"Given origination levels in the first quarter of this year, the findings in this report showed greater changes than expected,\" said ACES Executive Vice President Nick Volpe. \"Historically, defect rates decrease when there is a decline in origination levels; however, that was not the case for Q1. Mortgage lenders are no strangers to market adversity. While the market is shifting, we hope this report will serve as a reminder to reinforce quality control across the board.\"\\n\\nFindings for the Q1 ACES Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report are based on post-closing quality control data derived from the ACES Quality Management and Control® benchmarking system and incorporate data from prior quarters and/or calendar years, where applicable. All reviews and defect data evaluated for the report were based on loan audits selected by lenders for full file reviews.\\n\\n\"The current mortgage market presents distinct challenges that lenders must navigate with precision. Although the critical defect rate remains low by historical standards, the increase in a quarter with record-low origination volumes is concerning. Notable rises across underwriting categories and unexpected insurance defects need closer scrutiny from lenders,\" said Trevor Gauthier, CEO of ACES Quality Management. \"Overall, the data clearly shows that lenders are under increasing pressure to maintain quality amid changing market dynamics. A proactive approach to quality control is crucial for mitigating risk and ensuring long-term stability.\"\\n\\nThe Mortgage QC Industry Trends Reports are available for download, free of charge, at https://www.acesquality.com/resources/reports.\\n\\nAbout ACES Quality Management:\\n\\nACES Quality Management is the leading provider of enterprise quality management and control software for the financial services industry.

Tech\\'s thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\\n\\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\\n\\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favour since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union\\'s financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct. There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\\n\\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia.\\n\\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\\n\\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\\n\\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\\n\\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\\n\\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\\n\\nBIG SHIFT\\n\\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\\n\\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfil that,\" he said.\\n\\nNordea\\'s 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\\n\\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley\\'s Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use.

Calvert\\'s Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future.

Tech\\'s thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\\n\\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\\n\\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favour since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union\\'s financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct. There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\\n\\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia.\\n\\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\\n\\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\\n\\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\\n\\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\\n\\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\\n\\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\\n\\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfil that,\" he said.\\n\\nNordea\\'s 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\\n\\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley\\'s Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use. Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\\n\\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\\n\\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\\n\\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment. Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe challenge of increased demand for computing power and data centres is not lost on tech companies.\\n\\nMicrosoft, for example, said its supply chain emissions increased 30.9% in 2023, and Alphabet reported a 13% rise in total emissions, citing power and materials needs for data centers. Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\\n\\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\\n\\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert\\'s Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future. AI proponents say the technology could eventually help make other sectors more energy efficient.\\n\\nOne sign the companies are trying to power the boom with low-carbon energy is increasing investment in nuclear.\\n\\nAmazon said this year it was starting to buy nuclear power to supplement renewables.

It was originally published at The Conversation.\\n\\nIn nearly every country that hosts foreign-born citizens, immigration emerges as a lightning rod for controversy. The economic realities of immigration, however, are far more complex than the negative sound bites suggest.\\n\\nFar from being a burden, as critics claim, immigrants play pivotal roles in driving innovation, enhancing productivity and fostering economic growth in their adopted countries. They also elevate their adopted and origin countries\\' standings in global value chains, contributing to economic resilience.\\n\\nWe are economists who study global trade and migration, and our recent work reveals that immigrants contribute far more to the economic fabric of nations than previously understood.\\n\\nBy facilitating what\\'s known as \"trade in value added,\" or TiVA, immigrants play a crucial role in helping countries specialize their production, move up the value chain and significantly enhance trade sophistication.\\n\\nMoving up the value chain means progressing from producing basic, low-value goods to more complex, higher-value products. This shift involves improving skills, technology and production techniques, allowing a country to capture more economic value and develop advanced industries.\\n\\nSo, what exactly is trade in value added, and why is it important?\\n\\nIn today\\'s global economy, products are rarely made entirely in one country. Instead, different stages of production occur across multiple nations. TiVA measures each country\\'s contribution to a final product, providing clearer insight into global value chains. For instance, while an iPhone may be assembled in China, its components come from various countries, each adding value.\\n\\nOur study found that a 10% increase in immigrants from a particular country residing in one of the 38 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states leads to a 2.08% increase in the value added from their home country that becomes embedded in their host country\\'s exports to the world.\\n\\nThis effect was strongest in the services sector, followed closely by agriculture and manufacturing.\\n\\nTo understand how this works, consider Indian software engineers in Silicon Valley. Their understanding of the U.S. tech industry and India\\'s IT sector can lead to partnerships. These partnerships lead to Indian firms providing specialized coding services for American tech giants. The result? Higher-value U.S. tech exports that incorporate Indian expertise. This perfectly illustrates how immigrants boost trade in value added.\\n\\nOr take Chinese immigrants in Italy\\'s fashion industry. Their cultural knowledge might help Italian luxury brands tailor products for the Chinese market and connect Italian designers with highly skilled textile workers in China. The result? Italian fashion exports incorporate Chinese craftsmanship, elevating both countries\\' global fashion value chain positions.\\n\\nOur findings show that immigrants are pivotal bridges in global trade networks. They leverage their unique knowledge, skills and connections to strengthen economic bonds between nations. That\\'s in line with previous research showing the significant role immigrants play in fostering bilateral trade.\\n\\nIn an era of increasing skepticism toward globalization and migration, understanding the positive economic impacts of immigration is crucial. Our current and previous research, and the findings from related studies, indicate that rather than \"stealing jobs,\" immigrants often create value and new economic opportunities that might not otherwise exist.\\n\\nImmigrants bring diverse skills, knowledge and networks to their host countries that can enhance innovation, fill labor shortages and open new market opportunities. They often possess unique insights into their home country markets, helping host country firms navigate cultural nuances and business practices that might otherwise pose trade barriers.\\n\\nFor home countries, emigrants can serve as cultural ambassadors, creating awareness, showcasing products and services, and helping to integrate their homeland into global value chains. They may also contribute to knowledge transfer, investment flows and business connections that boost their home and host countries\\' economic development.\\n\\nMoreover, immigrants\\' ability to enhance trade in value added suggests they play a role in moving countries up the economic value chain. Rather than simply facilitating trade in raw materials or essential manufactured goods, immigrants appear to boost trade in more sophisticated, higher-value products and services. This is crucial for economic development, as countries that position themselves higher in global value chains tend to see bigger benefits.\\n\\nOur observations have important implications for both immigration and trade. For one, they suggest that restrictive immigration policies might have unintended consequences, hindering a country\\'s trade performance and position in global value chains. Countries that want to become more economically competitive might consider more open immigration policies.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, our research indicates that immigrants\\' economic benefits extend beyond the often-cited labor-market and fiscal impacts -- in other words, having more workers who pay more taxes.\\n\\nThe evidence suggests policymakers should take a more holistic view of immigration\\'s economic effects, considering its role in facilitating sophisticated international trade and value creation.\\n\\nOur results also align with previous research highlighting the potential value of workforce diversity for businesses, particularly for firms engaged in international trade. Employees from diverse national backgrounds can bring valuable insights and connections that help their companies navigate global markets and value chains.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that immigrants\\' impact on trade in value added varies across countries and sectors. This suggests that rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, targeted policies might most effectively leverage immigration for economic benefit.\\n\\nMaximizing immigration\\'s positive impacts on trade and value chains also requires supportive policies and institutions that allow immigrants to use their skills and networks fully. These might include programs to assist with economic integration, language training, credential recognition and support for immigrant entrepreneurship.\\n\\nAs the global economy continues to evolve, with value chains becoming ever more complex and interconnected, the role of immigrants as facilitators of trade and value creation is likely to grow even more significant. Countries that recognize and leverage this potential stand to gain a competitive edge in the global marketplace.\\n\\nOur research paints a picture of immigrants not as economic burdens but as valuable assets who enhance their host and home countries\\' positions in the global economy. By making sophisticated trade linkages possible, and by boosting participation in global value chains, immigrants contribute to economic growth and development in ways that go far beyond conventional understanding.\\n\\nAs debates around immigration continue, it\\'s crucial to move beyond simplistic narratives and recognize the complex and often subtle ways that immigrants contribute to prosperity. In an interconnected world, immigrants aren\\'t just crossing borders -- they are helping to weave the fabric of global trade and value creation.', 'source': {'uri': 'talkingpointsmemo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Talking Points Memo'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2147900762.jpg?w=804', 'eventUri': 'eng-9919940', 'sentiment': 0.2, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 26}, {'uri': '2024-10-510301181', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-09', 'time': '22:13:46', 'dateTime': '2024-10-09T22:13:46Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-09T21:56:12Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9921568632125854, 'url': 'https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/florida-based-fund-managers-brace-215612557.html', 'title': 'Florida-based fund managers brace for Hurricane Milton but remain committed to the state', 'body': '(Reuters) - Florida\\'s sun and low taxes enticed many hedge funds and other financial professionals to move south. Now another massive hurricane is putting that love affair to the test, but many big-name managers are committed to remaining in \"Wall Street South\" for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nThe state, facing the approaching Category 3 Hurricane Milton on Wednesday, has lured investors for years but its attractiveness only increased during the pandemic. Billionaire Carl Icahn uprooted his firm from New York to an office near Miami in 2020. Paul Singer\\'s Elliott Investment Management followed later that year with an announcement that it was opening a West Palm Beach office. And Ken Griffin\\'s Citadel said in 2022 that it was moving to Miami from Chicago.\\n\\nHurricane Milton is on course to pound Florida\\'s Gulf Coast late on Wednesday night or early on Thursday, threatening communities still recovering from Hurricane Helene last month. Milton was expected to stay at hurricane strength across the Florida peninsula, posing storm-surge danger on the state\\'s Atlantic Coast.\\n\\n\"We took the plunge with our eyes wide open,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at $52 billion Chicago-based Cresset Asset Management, about his move to Palm Beach on Florida\\'s east coast in 2015. His principal residence will stay in Palm Beach even though he plans to ride out this storm from his other home in the Blue Ridge Mountains of South Carolina.\\n\\nFor many other fund managers, the tradeoff between lower taxes and a favorable business climate versus the specter of insurance payments and the cost of rebuilding potentially annihilated real estate, still works in favor of Florida, according to people familiar with their thinking.\\n\\nThe big hedge funds that moved to Florida remain committed to maintaining their operations there, those people said. Similarly, other executives who moved their personal residences to the South during the pandemic while continuing to telecommute for firms based in the Northeast have every intention of staying put, according to two sources familiar with their thinking.\\n\\nOther Wall Street financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, have built up staff in Florida both to serve customers who moved and to accommodate employees eager to work from the South.\\n\\nCONTINGENCY PLANNING\\n\\nMany of the firms that moved - including Citadel, Elliott and Icahn - are based on or near Florida\\'s east coast where easy flights to New York and other locations were a draw, as was Miami\\'s bustling nightlife and vibrant arts scene. That has put them some 300 miles (483 km) east of where forecasters expect Milton to make landfall and wreak the most serious damage after\\n\\n\"If the need to evacuate were to arise in Miami, we have robust contingency plans for our employees, their loved ones and our businesses,\" said a Citadel spokesman. But the firm\\'s commitment to Florida, where founder Griffin was born, is clear. The company plans to build a 54-story tower as its new headquarters in Brickell, the buzzing Miami neighborhood that has become the heart of \"Wall Street South.\"\\n\\nA handful of financial industry firms, however, are based in the immediate path of Milton.\\n\\nOne founder of an $8 billion fund on Florida\\'s west coast flew in to the state to keep an eye on both his firm and his home, and now plans to ride out the storm on a high floor of his office building, people familiar with his thinking said.\\n\\nAnother firm in the path is Raymond James Financial, founded and still based in St. Petersburg. The 62-year-old brokerage and investment advisory firm evacuated staff from its head office on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe firm is maintaining service and support at back-up facilities and a spokesman declined to provide additional comment to its communications on social media.\\n\\nBlue Ocean Technologies ATS, a Florida-based financial technology company operating an overnight trading system for U.S. securities, has its executive offices just north of Miami in West Palm Beach, and has a backup plan.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been living here for 10 years, and the hurricanes have missed me for 10 years,\" said Brian Hyndman, president and CEO of Blue Ocean. The firm\\'s trading system, its trade-matching engine, is based in New Jersey. \"We can work remotely from home, and we\\'ve got backup and support on both the east and west coasts of the United States.\"\\n\\nLONGER-TERM IMPACT?\\n\\nTwo sources familiar with executive recruiting in Florida told Reuters they are concerned that experienced staff may become more reluctant to shoulder the growing expense and risk of living in a hurricane zone, and that hiring may become more costly or difficult.\\n\\nAverage homeowner premiums in Florida rose 57% between 2019 and 2023 according to data from Benjamin Keys of the University of Pennsylvania and Philip Mulder of the University of Wisconsin, a steeper rise than anywhere else in the nation. Average insurance costs were $4,060 last year, according to Keys.\\n\\nMel Montagne, president of FIRM, a nonprofit that lobbies for fairer insurance rates for Floridians, and who also sells commercial insurance, said clients have been getting nervous and wracked with buyer\\'s remorse.\\n\\n\"They are looking around and saying, \\'what the hell is this?\\'\" said Montagne, whose clients include finance industry executives who migrated to Florida during COVID.\\n\\n\"They are looking to sell to get the hell out of Dodge.\"\\n\\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee and Svea Herbst-Bayliss in New York; additional reporting by Michelle Conlin in New York and Andy Sullivan in Washington; editing by Megan Davies and Matthew Lewis)', 'source': {'uri': 'ca.finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

Tech\\'s thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\\n\\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\\n\\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favour since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union\\'s financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct. There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\\n\\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia.\\n\\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\\n\\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\\n\\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\\n\\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\\n\\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\\n\\nBIG SHIFT\\n\\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\\n\\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfil that,\" he said.\\n\\nNordea\\'s 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\\n\\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley\\'s Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use. Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\\n\\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\\n\\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\\n\\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment. Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nA CHALLENGE\\n\\nThe challenge of increased demand for computing power and data centres is not lost on tech companies.\\n\\nMicrosoft, for example, said its supply chain emissions increased 30.9% in 2023, and Alphabet reported a 13% rise in total emissions, citing power and materials needs for data centers. Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\\n\\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\\n\\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert\\'s Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future. AI proponents say the technology could eventually help make other sectors more energy efficient.\\n\\nOne sign the companies are trying to power the boom with low-carbon energy is increasing investment in nuclear.\\n\\nAmazon said this year it was starting to buy nuclear power to supplement renewables. And Microsoft said last week it had signed a deal to help resurrect a mothballed nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in the first restart of its kind in history.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which offers two Article 9 funds that track indexes with Google and Microsoft among their top five holdings, said improving sustainability data is making it easier to identify where portfolios need adjusting.\\n\\nThe Article 9 funds are built with the aim of showing a 7% average reduction in carbon emissions from all the constituent stocks combined every year, \"which means that over time companies that increase their carbon emissions will likely receive a lower weight in the fund,\" said Aurora Samuelsson, head of sustainability at Handelsbanken Asset Management.\\n\\n\"We raise and will raise the relevant and material issues in our dialogue with the companies,\" Samuelsson said.\\n\\n(Reporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Anna Driver)', 'source': {'uri': 'usnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'U.S. News & World Report'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/74643e6/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fe0%2F354d86967fe6510f4b973a20e5ef3c%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK8P0CG%3A12024-09-26T100406Z_1_LYNXMPEK8P0CG_RTROPTP_3_CLIMATE-TECH-INVESTING.JPG', 'eventUri': 'eng-9942552', 'sentiment': 0.411764705882353, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 10}, {'uri': '2024-10-503123589', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-02', 'time': '14:31:27', 'dateTime': '2024-10-02T14:31:27Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-02T12:02:49Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9921568632125854, 'url': 'https://www.eagletribune.com/region/duck-creek-technologies-launches-payments-facilitator-to-create-end-to-end-insurance-payment/article_82d35763-ee59-590f-9936-e47806beba1d.html', 'title': 'Duck Creek Technologies Launches Payments Facilitator to Create End-To-End Insurance Payment ...', 'body': 'BOSTON, Oct. 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Duck Creek Technologies, the intelligent solutions provider defining the future of property and casualty (P&C) and general insurance, today introduced its latest insurance-focused payments solution, the Duck Creek Payments Facilitator.

The economic realities of immigration, however, are far more complex than the negative sound bites suggest.\\n\\nFar from being a burden, as critics claim, immigrants play pivotal roles in driving innovation, enhancing productivity and fostering economic growth in their adopted countries. They also elevate their adopted and origin countries\\' standings in global value chains, contributing to economic resilience.\\n\\nWe are economists who study global trade and migration, and our recent work reveals that immigrants contribute far more to the economic fabric of nations than previously understood.\\n\\nBy facilitating what\\'s known as \"trade in value added,\" or TiVA, immigrants play a crucial role in helping countries specialize their production, move up the value chain and significantly enhance trade sophistication.\\n\\nMoving up the value chain means progressing from producing basic, low-value goods to more complex, higher-value products. This shift involves improving skills, technology and production techniques, allowing a country to capture more economic value and develop advanced industries.\\n\\nSo, what exactly is trade in value added, and why is it important?\\n\\nIn today\\'s global economy, products are rarely made entirely in one country. Instead, different stages of production occur across multiple nations. TiVA measures each country\\'s contribution to a final product, providing clearer insight into global value chains. For instance, while an iPhone may be assembled in China, its components come from various countries, each adding value.\\n\\nOur study found that a 10% increase in immigrants from a particular country residing in one of the 38 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states leads to a 2.08% increase in the value added from their home country that becomes embedded in their host country\\'s exports to the world.\\n\\nThis effect was strongest in the services sector, followed closely by agriculture and manufacturing.\\n\\nTo understand how this works, consider Indian software engineers in Silicon Valley. Their understanding of the U.S. tech industry and India\\'s IT sector can lead to partnerships. These partnerships lead to Indian firms providing specialized coding services for American tech giants. The result? Higher-value U.S. tech exports that incorporate Indian expertise. This perfectly illustrates how immigrants boost trade in value added.\\n\\nOr take Chinese immigrants in Italy\\'s fashion industry. Their cultural knowledge might help Italian luxury brands tailor products for the Chinese market and connect Italian designers with highly skilled textile workers in China. The result? Italian fashion exports incorporate Chinese craftsmanship, elevating both countries\\' global fashion value chain positions.\\n\\nOur findings show that immigrants are pivotal bridges in global trade networks. They leverage their unique knowledge, skills and connections to strengthen economic bonds between nations. That\\'s in line with previous research showing the significant role immigrants play in fostering bilateral trade.\\n\\nIn an era of increasing skepticism toward globalization and migration, understanding the positive economic impacts of immigration is crucial. Our current and previous research, and the findings from related studies, indicate that rather than \"stealing jobs,\" immigrants often create value and new economic opportunities that might not otherwise exist.\\n\\nImmigrants bring diverse skills, knowledge and networks to their host countries that can enhance innovation, fill labor shortages and open new market opportunities. They often possess unique insights into their home country markets, helping host country firms navigate cultural nuances and business practices that might otherwise pose trade barriers.\\n\\nFor home countries, emigrants can serve as cultural ambassadors, creating awareness, showcasing products and services, and helping to integrate their homeland into global value chains. They may also contribute to knowledge transfer, investment flows and business connections that boost their home and host countries\\' economic development.\\n\\nMoreover, immigrants\\' ability to enhance trade in value added suggests they play a role in moving countries up the economic value chain. Rather than simply facilitating trade in raw materials or essential manufactured goods, immigrants appear to boost trade in more sophisticated, higher-value products and services. This is crucial for economic development, as countries that position themselves higher in global value chains tend to see bigger benefits.\\n\\nOur observations have important implications for both immigration and trade. For one, they suggest that restrictive immigration policies might have unintended consequences, hindering a country\\'s trade performance and position in global value chains. Countries that want to become more economically competitive might consider more open immigration policies.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, our research indicates that immigrants\\' economic benefits extend beyond the often-cited labor-market and fiscal impacts - in other words, having more workers who pay more taxes.\\n\\nThe evidence suggests policymakers should take a more holistic view of immigration\\'s economic effects, considering its role in facilitating sophisticated international trade and value creation.\\n\\nOur results also align with previous research highlighting the potential value of workforce diversity for businesses, particularly for firms engaged in international trade. Employees from diverse national backgrounds can bring valuable insights and connections that help their companies navigate global markets and value chains.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that immigrants\\' impact on trade in value added varies across countries and sectors. This suggests that rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, targeted policies might most effectively leverage immigration for economic benefit.\\n\\nMaximizing immigration\\'s positive impacts on trade and value chains also requires supportive policies and institutions that allow immigrants to use their skills and networks fully. These might include programs to assist with economic integration, language training, credential recognition and support for immigrant entrepreneurship.\\n\\nAs the global economy continues to evolve, with value chains becoming ever more complex and interconnected, the role of immigrants as facilitators of trade and value creation is likely to grow even more significant. Countries that recognize and leverage this potential stand to gain a competitive edge in the global marketplace.\\n\\nOur research paints a picture of immigrants not as economic burdens but as valuable assets who enhance their host and home countries\\' positions in the global economy. By making sophisticated trade linkages possible, and by boosting participation in global value chains, immigrants contribute to economic growth and development in ways that go far beyond conventional understanding.\\n\\nAs debates around immigration continue, it\\'s crucial to move beyond simplistic narratives and recognize the complex and often subtle ways that immigrants contribute to prosperity. In an interconnected world, immigrants aren\\'t just crossing borders - they are helping to weave the fabric of global trade and value creation.\\n\\nThe authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.', 'source': {'uri': 'foreignaffairs.co.nz', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'foreignaffairs.co.nz'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz', 'name': 'Mil-Osi Publisher', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': None, 'eventUri': 'eng-9919940', 'sentiment': 0.2549019607843137, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 26}, {'uri': '8354302599', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-08', 'time': '07:55:23', 'dateTime': '2024-10-08T07:55:23Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-08T07:54:27Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9921568632125854, 'url': 'https://gritdaily.com/atfx-announces-strategic-investment-in-spark-systems-to-enhance-institutional-offerings/', 'title': 'ATFX Announces Strategic Investment in Spark Systems to Enhance Institutional Offerings - Grit Daily News', 'body': 'ATFX is pleased to announce its investment in Spark Systems, a next generation, institutional-grade eFX trading platform based in Singapore serving clients in Asia and globally.

To stop those lawsuits, J&J subsidiary Red River Talc filed for bankruptcy protection in Houston bankruptcy court.\\n\\nThe company has denied the allegations and has called its products safe.\\n\\nErik Haas, J&J\\'s worldwide vice president of litigation, said on Friday that the settlement was \"fair and equitable to all parties\" and that 83% of current talc claimants had voted for it.\\n\\nAfter being rebuffed twice by federal courts, New Brunswick New Jersey-based J&J is attempting again to end the litigation in a so-called \"Texas two-step\" bankruptcy.\\n\\nThe \"two-step\" maneuver involves offloading its talc liability onto a newly created subsidiary that then declares Chapter 11, a type of bankruptcy that involves a reorganization of assets and debts under court supervision. The goal is to use the proceeding to force all plaintiffs into one settlement, without requiring J&J itself to file for bankruptcy.\\n\\nBankruptcy judges can enforce global settlements that permanently halt all related lawsuits and forbid new ones.\\n\\nOutside of bankruptcy, any settlement J&J reached with some claimants would still leave holdouts or future plaintiffs with the right to sue - and leave the company exposed to potential multibillion-dollar verdicts that encouraged it to use a two-step in the first place.\\n\\nTo improve its chances in a third bankruptcy effort, J&J asked plaintiffs to vote on its proposed deal ahead of time to ensure that it has enough support for its plan to succeed. J&J needed more than 75% to back the plan for a bankruptcy judge to impose the deal on all plaintiffs.\\n\\nJ&J\\'s third attempt at a bankruptcy settlement also differs from its previous efforts in part because it focuses only on ovarian and other gynecological cancer claims, building on J&J\\'s previous settlements with state attorneys general and people who had sued after developing mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure.\\n\\nJ&J\\'s proposed settlement would pay talc claimants about $10 billion over 25 years. The present value of the settlement is roughly $8 billion after J&J recently agreed to kick in an additional $1.1 billion to the settlement fund and pay $650 million in legal fees to attorneys that had previously opposed the settlement offer.\\n\\nThe company has been engaged in a bitter fight with lawyers opposing its third attempt to settle the litigation through this maneuver.\\n\\nIts bankruptcy strategy still faces legal hurdles. These include a June U.S. Supreme Court decision involving Purdue Pharma\\'s bankruptcy, court orders dismissing its previous efforts and proposed federal legislation aimed at preventing financially healthy companies like J&J from benefiting from bankruptcy protection.\\n\\n(Reporting by Dietrich Knauth in New York; Additional reporting by Bhanvi Satija in Bengaluru; Editing by Will Dunham, Leigh Jones, Sandra Maler and Shounak Dasgupta)\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE', 'source': {'uri': 'gazette.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Colorado Springs Gazette'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/1a/d1a1330c-0200-522c-a4a1-38e32ccaa072/66edcfced9b46.image.jpg?crop=800%2C420%2C0%2C56&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-9924115', 'sentiment': -0.1450980392156863, 'wgt': 243, 'relevance': 54}, {'uri': '2024-10-514855402', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-14', 'time': '20:36:16', 'dateTime': '2024-10-14T20:36:16Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-14T20:05:21Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9490196108818054, 'url': 'https://www.sudbury.com/national-business/stock-market-today-wall-street-gains-ground-and-adds-to-its-records-9655637', 'title': 'Stock market today: Wall Street gains ground and adds to its records', 'body': 'NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stock indexes closed higher on Wall Street, adding to their all-time highs.

He pinpointed reports from several major banks, along with Netflix and Taiwan Semiconductor.\\n\\n\"We\\'re at the beginning of one of the year\\'s four reporting periods,\" he said. \"They\\'re jumbled. They\\'re open to a lot of interpretation. They\\'re fast. So listen to the calls, ponder a moment, and only then should you pull the trigger.\"\\n\\nBut on Monday, Cramer said he won\\'t be focused on earnings. Instead, investors will be digesting China\\'s new stimulus package, which is set to be released this weekend. He expressed optimism about the Chinese economy if the government can invest billions in real estate and the stock market.\\n\\nTuesday brings reports from major players in the financial sector: Charles Schwab, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup. Wall Street hasn\\'t favored Schwab as of late, but Cramer wondered if that could change after this report. He\\'s said he\\'s confident in the success of Goldman Sachs and noted that analysts have been positive on Citigroup. Bank of America could see a boost now that Warren Buffett is no longer required to frequently report his sales of the stock, Cramer added.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson, Walgreens and UnitedHealth Group also report earnings on Tuesday, with Cramer noting that the latter regularly beats expectations. Johnson & Johnson this week saw a new development in its ongoing talc lawsuits that could aid resolution efforts. Cramer suggested the company might be closer to putting its litigation troubles to bed so investors can start to focus on earnings. He also predicted Walgreens\\' quarter will disappoint.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Morgan Stanley and Abbott Laboratories will report. Morgan Stanley shares have climbed since the company brought on a new CEO at the beginning of the year, Cramer said, suggesting investors \"hold on for the ride.\" Although the future of Abbott Laboratories\\' lawsuits remains up in the air, Cramer said recent comments from the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Protection and the National Institutes of Health -- which suggest that the contentious baby formula doesn\\'t seem to harm infants -- could turn the tide in the company\\'s favor.\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor reports on Thursday, and Cramer said the stock has been strong because it manufactures highly-valued chips from Nvidia.

SLB and American Express also report earnings on Friday, and Cramer noted the former company\\'s stock hasn\\'t \"been able to catch fire\" even as oil prices have risen in recent weeks.

Inc. (BHC) in 2022, is working with Goldman Sachs to explore a deal and expects to draw interest from private equity firms, the FT reported.\\n\\nBausch Health is the former Valeant, a company that grew rapidly thanks to a string of acquisitions that left it with $21 billion in debt, almost $10 billion of which will mature in 2027.\\n\\nBausch Health retained an 88% stake in Bausch + Lomb after listing the shares and planned to offload the rest in a deal with investors that would have seen it exchange Bausch Health shares for Bausch + Lomb stock.\\n\\nBut the process was upended by doubts about whether the parent would still be solvent after separating from Bausch + Lomb, which is a major revenue contributor. The parent would have to pass a solvency test in order for the deal to be approved.\\n\\nBausch Health is also facing the expiry of the patent on its lead drug Xifaxan in 2029. The drug, a treatment for gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel syndrome, has become the subject of legal battles over the patent.\\n\\nCreditors, including Apollo, Elliott Management and GoldenTree Asset Management, had raised concerns about the spinoff plan because of the effect it would have on Bausch Health\\'s balance sheet.\\n\\nBausch Health\\'s leading shareholders include funds run by billionaire Carl Icahn and John Paulson\\'s fund. They favored the spinoff plan as a way to get a greater share of the eyecare business. Bausch + Lomb is one of the leading contact-lens suppliers in the world.\\n\\nBausch Health and Goldman Sachs declined to comment to the FT.\\n\\nBausch + Lomb is headed by Brent Saunders, a longtime pharmaceutical executive known for leading Allergan into a much-hyped but failed $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc. (PFE) in 2015 and then into an acquisition by AbbVie for $63 billion in cash and stock in 2020.\\n\\nSee also: After IPO, Bausch + Lomb turns to an industry favorite to run the company\\n\\nNeedham & Co. analysts said they were not surprised by the report and that private equity was the most likely buyer.\\n\\n\"There are only a few strategics that would make sense, in our view, and all would likely run into anti-trust challenges,\" senior analyst David Saxon wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nHe named medical-device peers Alcon Inc. (ALC), Cooper Cos. (COO) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) as examples of companies that would hit anti-trust issues given each has 25% to 40% of the contact lens market.\\n\\nIn the pharma segment, AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) would also encounter antitrust issues given its Restasis has a 45% share of the prescription dry-eye market.\\n\\n\"Given these points, a sale to a strategic would likely require splitting up BLCO, so private equity would make for a cleaner transaction,\" Saxon wrote.\\n\\nIt may not be enough for Bausch Health, however, which the analyst estimates has leverage of 9.0x.\\n\\n\"If BLCO were to be sold for $26 and BHC uses all of the after-tax proceeds to repay debt, BHC\\'s year-end leverage would be 5.1x and it would still have $12.3B in remaining debt,\" he wrote. \"In this scenario, it is uncertain a BLCO sale would alleviate investors\\' concerns around BHC\\'s solvency and could be challenged by BHC creditors.\"\\n\\nNeedham has a hold rating on Bausch + Lomb\\'s stock.\\n\\nThe stock has gained 8% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX has gained 18%.\\n\\nRead now: Bausch Health responds to rumors, says it is not considering bankruptcy\\n\\n-Ciara Linnane\\n\\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tech\\'s thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\\n\\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\\n\\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favour since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union\\'s financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct.

Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\\n\\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\\n\\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\\n\\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment. Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nA CHALLENGE\\n\\nThe challenge of increased demand for computing power and data centres is not lost on tech companies.\\n\\nMicrosoft, for example, said its supply chain emissions increased 30.9% in 2023, and Alphabet reported a 13% rise in total emissions, citing power and materials needs for data centers. Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\\n\\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\\n\\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert\\'s Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future. AI proponents say the technology could eventually help make other sectors more energy efficient.\\n\\nOne sign the companies are trying to power the boom with low-carbon energy is increasing investment in nuclear.\\n\\nAmazon said this year it was starting to buy nuclear power to supplement renewables. And Microsoft said last week it had signed a deal to help resurrect a mothballed nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in the first restart of its kind in history.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which offers two Article 9 funds that track indexes with Google and Microsoft among their top five holdings, said improving sustainability data is making it easier to identify where portfolios need adjusting.\\n\\nThe Article 9 funds are built with the aim of showing a 7% average reduction in carbon emissions from all the constituent stocks combined every year, \"which means that over time companies that increase their carbon emissions will likely receive a lower weight in the fund,\" said Aurora Samuelsson, head of sustainability at Handelsbanken Asset Management.\\n\\n\"We raise and will raise the relevant and material issues in our dialogue with the companies,\" Samuelsson said.\\n\\n(Reporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Anna Driver)', 'source': {'uri': 'usnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'U.S. News & World Report'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/74643e6/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fe0%2F354d86967fe6510f4b973a20e5ef3c%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK8P0CG%3A12024-09-26T100406Z_1_LYNXMPEK8P0CG_RTROPTP_3_CLIMATE-TECH-INVESTING.JPG', 'eventUri': 'eng-9942552', 'sentiment': 0.411764705882353, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 60}, {'uri': '8337944028', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-09-26', 'time': '10:31:01', 'dateTime': '2024-09-26T10:31:01Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-09-26T10:30:16Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9921568632125854, 'url': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-power-thirst-complicates-esg-investors-love-affair-with-tech-stocks/', 'title': \"Power thirst complicates ESG investors' love affair with tech stocks\", 'body': 'Investors who manage hundreds of billions of dollars are pressing Microsoft, Alphabet and others for more information on the power needed for artificial intelligence and advanced computing, to help decide whether the sector should stay heavily represented in sustainable funds, investors said.\\n\\nWhile these conversations are at an early stage, six fund industry executives in Europe and the United States said they are looking more closely at the environmental impact of the AI boom, which Goldman Sachs estimates will boost data center power demand 160% by 2030.\\n\\nNone of the investors contacted by Reuters said they were considering divesting.\\n\\nSome of the biggest tech companies leading the AI race that requires building and powering data centers have started reporting increased greenhouse gas emissions, raising questions from asset managers who want to show their portfolios do well not only financially but also by the environment.

The benchmark S&P 500 index, Nasdaq and Dow are on track for their biggest daily declines since early August.\\n\\nShares of chip stocks were hard hit, with AI heavyweight Nvidia tumbling nearly 10% and Wall Street\\'s chip index the PHLX chip index slumping 8%.\\n\\nTODD SOHN, ETF STRATEGIST, STRATEGAS LLC, NEW YORK:\\n\\n\"Such a massive amount of money has gone to tech and semiconductors in the last 12 months that the trade is completely skewed. Since the Fed paused rate increases a year ago, more than $30 billion has flowed into U.S. technology-related ETFs; meanwhile all other sector ETFs lost $10 billion in the same time period. Tactical allocations go into those sector ETFs, and imbalances like this can persist for a while, but eventually, the steam runs out of the trade.\\n\\n\"Then there are the earnings - it\\'s also hard to keep beating those high expectations. Plus, now we have Broadcom\\'s results due Thursday. And if you put ten people in a room and asked them why this is happening, at least one would point to the election and the possibility that a new administration would do something to tariffs that would affect chips.\\n\\n\"Finally, while it wouldn\\'t be at the top of my list, there\\'s the calendar. People may have woken up this morning and realized it\\'s September, which historically is not a great month for stocks. Add to that the fact that so far this year the largest drawdown we\\'ve seen in the S&P 500 is about 8%, and that typically we\\'d see something around 14%, people are nervous.\"\\n\\nSTEVE SOSNICK, MARKET STRATEGIST, INTERACTIVE BROKERS, GREENWICH, CT.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a bit of a post-Nvidia earnings hangover going on today. Those earnings last week were fine; they exceeded expectations. But the magnitude of the beats is shrinking quarter by quarter and that\\'s not lost on investors. The stock had rallied going into earnings - a huge amount of investment poured into it - and so it wasn\\'t just sufficient to be good, it had to be great. And Friday\\'s rally took place in remarkably light volume ahead of a long weekend that happened to coincide with the end of the month, so the typical markup that happens at the end of a calendar month met no resistance.\\n\\n\"This week is different, and so you\\'ve seen a nasty day. There\\'s concern about what the job numbers are going to show, about seasonality. That\\'s why the VIX is higher. I don\\'t think the ISM number, showing a weaker manufacturing sector but higher prices, was at all helpful. And there you have it. Gravity.\"\\n\\nDENNIS DICK, TRADER AT TRIPLE D TRADING:\\n\\n\"If you look at the action on Friday, everything was rallying, but Nvidia was lagging. So, you could see the relative strength was poor after their earnings print. It hasn\\'t been good since then.\"\\n\\n\"September is seasonally a very weak month of the year, so I think people are nervous. People are just using this as an excuse to take profits and the most likely candidates to take profits are the semis, because they\\'ve been the strongest.\"\\n\\nSTEPHEN MASSOCCA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEDBUSH SECURITIES, SAN FRANCISCO:\\n\\n\"We ran right back up to the new high again. There was absolutely zero news over the weekend that meant anything to anybody. But here we are down 600 points.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re expensive. They\\'re not cheap stocks. I mean, wow, I don\\'t know what Nvidia needed to do in the quarter... It was a pretty freaking good quarter, a couple minor issues, but it just goes to show you these things are just very expensive.\\n\\n\"It also becomes a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy because so much money now flows into ETFs and so much money flows into S&P and target funds and all that. It just gets spread across the market and it gets spread across the market on a market cap weighted basis, so it sort of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you\\'re one of the top market cap names in the S&P 500 and all the money is pouring into S&P 500 ETFs funds, how does that not help you? And I think that\\'s part of it, and that\\'s part of why you get these stretched valuations.\"\\n\\nBRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANNEX WEALTH MANAGEMENT, BROOKFIELD, WI\\n\\n\"People are worrying and thinking about all kinds of macro issues. Has the Fed fumbled the ball? The fear is that it is tripping over its own feet when it comes to the timing and pace of rate cuts instead of sticking the landing. Will the jobs report increase the odds of a recession? The biggest thing here is the possibility that investors will sell what has gone up the most in the face of any softening.\"\\n\\nSCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE\\n\\n\"We came in with the futures down but once this ISM number came out it triggered this fall.\"\\n\\n\"The market is worried about how drastic the slowdown is going to be. The tech sector, even with this pullback we\\'ve had today, it\\'s still up a lot for the year and these things have moved a lot. These stocks led the chart up and on down days they will lead the chart down. When you look at something like 2/10 inversions the last 8 recessions curve has gone positive before recession occurs and we\\'re only a few basis points away. The market is thinking about that too.\"\\n\\nMICHAEL GREEN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SIMPLIFY, SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA\\n\\n\"People are over allocated to Nvidia and many of these names and they\\'re trying to reduce that exposure. It just has the potential for these things to sell off quite significantly\"\\n\\n\"I also think there is a derisking related to election as the election season officially starts now when people are back from Labor Day and everybody is off the beach. Everybody looked at their portfolios and said that going into the political uncertainty of a tight election, we want to have less risk. The PMI report was an excuse for that.\"\\n\\nCALLIE COX, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RITHOLTZ WEALTH MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK\\n\\n\"Stocks are starting the fall off on a sour note, yet it\\'s hard to say exactly why people are selling today. Tech is dragging the index down, with Nvidia accounting for about a third of the S&P 500\\'s losses. We saw a manufacturing report come out this morning that suggests goods demand is slowing. But it wasn\\'t shockingly bad data, and the narrative of slowing demand isn\\'t exactly surprising.\\n\\n\"I\\'d pin some of the drop on seasonality. September is typically a rough month of the year for the stock market - and the S&P 500 has fallen on the Tuesday after Labor Day every year since 2016. People may simply just be catching up to what they missed during the dog days of summer.\\n\\n\"Believe in this bull market, but shield yourself against rash decisions in what could be a turbulent fall. And don\\'t get distracted by short-term market swings. Since 1950, 60% of market selloffs haven\\'t reached correction territory, and 26% have ended before the dreaded bear market level.\"\\n\\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee, Noel Randewich, Chuck Mikolajczak, Chibuike Oguh, David Randall, Laura Matthews and Carolina Mandl; Compiled by Megan Davies)', 'source': {'uri': 'ca.finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

The previously stated amount of Bitcoin HODL held at August 31, 2024 was incorrect. The accurate figure is 2,567 Bitcoins, not 2,533 Bitcoins. This correction does not change anything else in the news release. The corrected release follows:\\n\\nVancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - September 5, 2024) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\") a pioneer in green energy-powered blockchain infrastructure, is pleased to announce its unaudited production results for August 2024. The Company successfully mined 112 Bitcoin, boosting its total Bitcoin holdings by 1%, bringing the balance to 2,567 BTC. HIVE also announced the acquisition of 1,000 Bitmain S21 Pro Antminers for immediate delivery to upgrade its existing suite of machines, enhancing overall mining efficiency and capacity. HIVE maintained an impressive average Bitcoin mining capacity of over 5.0 Exahash per second (\"EH/s\") throughout the month, all while continuing its commitment to green energy by primarily sourcing hydroelectricity to power its data centers (all amounts in US dollars, unless otherwise indicated).\\n\\nHIVE emphasizes that with a Bitcoin HODL value exceeding $164 million as of August 31, 2024, the Company\\'s enterprise value remains compelling compared to industry peers.\\n\\nExecutive Insights:\\n\\nFrank Holmes, Executive Chairman, commented, \"We remain focused on our strategy of maintaining the lowest G&A expenses per Bitcoin mined, maximizing cash flow return on invested capital, and achieving high revenue per employee while minimizing share dilution. Our disciplined approach, supported by a global team operating across nine time zones, positions HIVE as one of the leanest Bitcoin mining operations with an attractive EV to EBITDA multiple, holding over 2,500 clean and green Bitcoin on our balance sheet.\"\\n\\nAydin Kilic, President and CEO added, \"Over the past month, we have optimized our fleet\\'s performance, achieving an average hashrate of approximately 5.2 EH/s by fine-tuning the firmware of our 30 J/TH machines, improving their efficiency to 27-28 J/TH. This has led to a global fleet efficiency of approximately 23 J/TH. We plan to continue this optimization over the next nine months, upgrading our remaining 30 J/TH ASICs. This will increase our installed hashrate at existing facilities to 6.9 EH/s with a blended fleet efficiency of 19 TH/s.\"\\n\\nHe further noted, \"To support this strategy, we have acquired 1,000 Bitmain S21 Pro Antminers for immediate delivery to upgrade our existing suite of equipment. Additionally, we have purchased 300 Bitmain S19 XP (NASDAQ:XP) miners to fully utilize available rack space at our Lachute facility. These machines were purchased and installed in August.\"\\n\\nWith this monthly rolling upgrade strategy, HIVE\\'s updated target hashrate is projected to reach 13.5 EH/s, with a global blended fleet efficiency of 16.9 J/TH upon the completion of the Paraguay facility. This will be achieved while maintaining our green energy strategy, which prioritizes the use of hydroelectricity to power our data centers.\\n\\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. went public in 2017 as the first cryptocurrency mining company listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange with a focus on sustainable green energy.\\n\\nHIVE is a growth-oriented technology stock in the emergent blockchain industry. As a company whose shares trade on a major stock exchange, we are building a bridge between the digital currency and blockchain sector and traditional capital markets.

United States Steel became the first $1 billion company in 1901. General Motors then rode the automotive revolution to become the first $10 billion company in 1955. In 2018, Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion milestone thanks to the success of its iPhone.\\n\\nApple remains the world's largest company with a $3.3 trillion market capitalization, but it has since been joined in the trillion-dollar club by tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet.\\n\\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) might be set to join them. It's currently valued at $761 billion, so its stock only needs to gain 31.4% from here to earn its membership. Here's why I think it will happen.\\n\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\n\\nBroadcom stock has soared recently, prompting a split\\n\\nBroadcom was originally a semiconductor and electronics company, but since merging with Avago Technologies in 2016, it has been on an acquisition spree. It spent a total of nearly $100 billion buying semiconductor equipment company CA Technologies in 2018, cybersecurity giant Symantec in 2019, and cloud software developer VMware in 2023.\\n\\nThe acquisitions have propelled Broadcom stock to a 465% gain over the last five years and, earlier this year, it soared past $1,800, which made it somewhat inaccessible to investors with small portfolios. As a result, Broadcom's management team decided to execute a 10-for-1 stock split, which increased the number of shares in circulation tenfold and reduced the price per share by a proportional amount.\\n\\nThe split went into effect on July 12, so investors can now buy one share of Broadcom for just $162 as of this writing. That spells an opportunity because the company's growing presence in artificial intelligence (AI) could drive further upside from here.\\n\\nA multifaceted artificial intelligence company\\n\\nBroadcom has placed a heavy focus on AI across its organization over the past year to capture what could be one of the most valuable technological revolutions in history.\\n\\nOn the semiconductor side, Broadcom makes data center accelerators, which are specially designed chips for AI development. It also supplies networking equipment for data centers, including Ethernet switches that regulate how quickly data travels from one point to another. High-quality switches are critical to AI infrastructure, because data needs to rapidly flow through tens of thousands of graphics processors (GPUs) and accelerators.\\n\\nDuring the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its custom AI accelerators segment grew by three-and-a-half times compared to the year-ago period thanks to surging demand from hyperscalers (which typically includes Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet). The company also said its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches delivered fourfold sales growth compared to the year-ago period.\\n\\nOutside of the semiconductor business, Symantec is weaving AI into its cybersecurity products. For example, it launched SymantecAI earlier this year, which is a chatbot capable of answering users' queries about their endpoint protection.\\n\\nThen, there is VMware, which serves as the software layer of the data center to help organizations optimize their infrastructure. They can use VMware to create virtual machines, meaning multiple employees can plug into the same server to utilize all of its capacity. That ensures no computing capacity goes to waste, which is critical right now due to the short supply of high-powered GPUs and data center hardware.\\n\\nBroadcom expects to deliver $51.5 billion in total revenue for the entirety of fiscal 2024, which will wrap up at the end of October. The company's guidance initially suggested $11 billion of that would be attributable to AI across its businesses, but it just raised that estimate to $12 billion, which highlights the significant momentum in this emerging space.\\n\\nBroadcom's (mathematical) path to the $1 trillion club\\n\\nAs I touched on at the top, Broadcom has a market cap of $761 billion right now, so its stock only needs to gain 31.4% from here to place the company in the $1 trillion club.\\n\\nThe company isn't consistently profitable on a GAAP basis, so it can't be valued using the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, we can value it using the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which divides its market cap by its annual revenue.\\n\\nBroadcom currently trades at a P/S ratio of 16. If that number remains constant, the company simply has to grow its annual revenue by 31.4% to justify its entry into the $1 trillion club. Wall Street expects Broadcom's revenue to grow by 17.2% in fiscal 2025, which won't be enough, but it could get there in fiscal 2026 if it can grow by that amount again.\\n\\nThere is a caveat. Although Broadcom's P/S ratio is down from its peak of around 19, it's still very expensive compared to its average of 8.7 over the last five years:\\n\\nAVGO PS Ratio data by YCharts\\n\\nIt's clear why investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock right now -- Broadcom's AI semiconductor products are delivering explosive growth, and its acquisitions are adding a tremendous amount of value. However, there is no guarantee investors will be receptive to such a high P/S ratio over the long term, and a reduction back to its five-year average could add years to Broadcom's quest to join the $1 trillion club.\\n\\nTherefore, while Broadcom will be a spectacular stock to own during the AI revolution, investors should maintain a very long-term outlook (perhaps of a decade or more) if they buy it today. That will give the company plenty of time to grow into its current valuation.\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Broadcom wasn't one of them.

Wall Street has a new hot trend, and its name is stock-split euphoria.\\n\\nA stock split allows publicly traded companies the ability to adjust their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. However, these changes are purely superficial and don\\'t impact a company\\'s market cap or its operating performance.\\n\\nSince 2024 began, 13 outstanding companies have announced and/or completed a stock split, including (all are forward-stock splits, unless otherwise noted):\\n\\nAmong these top-notch stock-split stocks are two magnificent, inexpensive companies that are begging to be bought in September, as well as two highfliers that are priced for perfection and worth avoiding.\\n\\nThe first phenomenal stock-split stock you can scoop up with confidence in September is the only company of the 13 listed above that\\'s set to conduct a reverse-stock split: satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings.\\n\\nWhereas most companies completing reverse splits are doing so from a position of operating weakness, this isn\\'t the case with Sirius XM. Its roughly 3.85 billion outstanding shares have held its stock in the mid-single-digits for a decade, which might be a deterrent for some institutional investors who deem its low share price too risky. This reverse split will take place following the merger of Sirius XM with Liberty Media\\'s Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group in a little over week, and likely make shares more attractive to big-money investors.\\n\\nWhat investors get with Sirius XM is easily identifiable competitive advantages. For example, it\\'s the only licensed satellite-radio operator in the country, which affords it substantial subscription pricing power.\\n\\nSirius XM also generates its revenue differently than terrestrial and online radio providers. Instead of relying almost exclusively on advertising, as traditional radio companies do, Sirius XM has generated 77% of its net sales from subscriptions through the first-half of 2024. People are much less likely to cancel their service during periods of economic turbulence than businesses are to pare back to marketing budgets at the first sign(s) of trouble. In other words, Sirius XM is better positioned to navigate uncertain economic climates.\\n\\nA forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 10, coupled with a dividend yield of 3.4%, makes Sirius XM stock quite the bargain for opportunistic long-term investors.\\n\\nThe other magnificent stock-split stock that\\'s begging to be bought in September is none other than Japan-based electronics goliath Sony Group. Sony\\'s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are set to undergo a 5-for-1 split on Oct. 8.\\n\\nEven though we\\'re coming up on four years since Sony introduced the PlayStation 5, and it\\'s perfectly normal to see gaming console sales taper off late in the cycle, Sony has found a couple of ways to boost one of its top revenue channels.\\n\\nFor instance, it\\'s increasing the price of PlayStation 5 by about 19% in Japan to counter challenging economic conditions. It\\'s also seeing strong subscription sales growth from PlayStation Plus, which allows subscribers to play games with their friends and store gaming data in the cloud.\\n\\nThough it\\'s best-known for gaming, Sony Group is a diverse company. It\\'s one of the primary suppliers of image sensors used in smartphones. With telecom companies upgrading their wireless networks to support faster download speeds, consumers and businesses have been steadily trading in their old devices for new ones that are 5G-capable. The 5G revolution is providing a healthy boost to Sony\\'s Imaging and Sensing Solutions segment.\\n\\nA forward P/E of 16 is a fair (if not inexpensive) price to pay for a wonderful company that\\'ll likely be introducing a new gaming console in about two years\\' time.\\n\\nHowever, not every stock-split stock is worth buying. Even though Nvidia has been the hottest megacap stock on the planet since the start of 2023, and its H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) is the preferred choice in AI-accelerated data centers, there are too many potential red flags to ignore.\\n\\nA point I\\'ve been trying to drive home for months is that there hasn\\'t been a next-big-thing innovation, technology, or trend that\\'s escaped an early stage bubble-bursting event in 30 years. This is a nice way of saying that investors always overestimate how quickly new innovations/technologies are adopted by consumers and businesses.\\n\\nThe simple fact that most businesses lack a defined game plan for their AI data center investments strongly suggests that we\\'re witnessing the next in a long line of bubbles with AI. If and when the AI bubble bursts, I\\'d expect Nvidia\\'s stock to be clobbered.\\n\\nCompetitive pressures can also no longer be ignored. Advanced Micro Devices is ramping up production of its MI300X AI-GPU, which is substantially cheaper than the H100, and doesn\\'t face the same supply chain constraints as Nvidia\\'s chips.\\n\\nBeyond external competition, Nvidia may lose out on valuable data center space from its top customers. The four members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" that account for around 40% of Nvidia\\'s net sales are developing AI chips of their own. Even with Nvidia\\'s H100 and Blackwell chips almost certainly hanging onto their computing advantage, we\\'re witnessing a concerted effort by America\\'s most-influential businesses to reduce their reliance on Nvidia\\'s hardware.\\n\\nNvidia\\'s sequentially declining adjusted gross margin suggests we\\'ve witnessed the peak of the latest hot trend on Wall Street.\\n\\nThe other stock-split stock of the 13 that\\'s worth avoiding in September is AI-inspired enterprise analytics software company MicroStrategy.\\n\\nAlthough MicroStrategy is, technically, a software company, almost the entirety of its $27.2 billion market cap (as of this writing on Aug. 27) is derived from the Bitcoin (BTC -0.18%) it holds. As of July 31, MicroStrategy held 226,500 Bitcoins, which is more than 1% of the entire supply that\\'ll ever be mined. It also makes MicroStrategy the top corporate holder of the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency.\\n\\nThere are lot of ways to wager on Bitcoin if you\\'re a crypto optimist. However, buying MicroStrategy stock is, arguably, the worst possible way to do it. With Bitcoin trading at $59,338 per token, as of this writing, MicroStrategy\\'s Bitcoin portfolio is worth $13.44 billion. Yet, its market cap of $27.2 billion (placing a fair value estimate on the software segment of around $1 billion), implies a value of roughly $115,650 per token. Investors are paying a 95% premium for its Bitcoin assets, which makes no sense.\\n\\nAnother reason to shy away from MicroStrategy has to do with how the company is financing its Bitcoin purchases. With minimal positive operating cash flow generated from its software segment, CEO Michael Saylor has overseen a number of convertible-debt offerings to fund its acquisition of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin were to enter a steep bear market, as it\\'s done a couple of times over the last decade, MicroStrategy could struggle to meet its debt obligations.\\n\\nLastly, I\\'m not convinced that Bitcoin is in any way superior in the crypto arena. Its scarcity is based on lines of computer code that could, in theory, be altered with community consensus. Most importantly, Bitcoin\\'s payment network isn\\'t anywhere close to the fastest or the cheapest. It\\'s a first-mover network that\\'s been outdone by third-generation blockchain networks. MicroStrategy tethering its future to Bitcoin looks like a mistake I\\'d suggest avoiding.', 'source': {'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'sean_williams@fool.com', 'name': 'Sean Williams', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/788803/stock-certificate-investment-retire-heirloom-donate-capital-gains-tax-getty.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9874292', 'sentiment': 0.4980392156862745, 'wgt': 236, 'relevance': 38}, {'uri': '2024-09-499727111', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-09-29', 'time': '09:47:54', 'dateTime': '2024-09-29T09:47:54Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-09-29T09:42:00Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9254902005195618, 'url': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/prediction-nvidia-stock-will-surge-2025-heres-why', 'title': \"Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Surge Into 2025. Here's Why.\", 'body': \"After a blistering run since early 2023, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has hit a wall. The stock has surged 730% since the start of last year (as of this writing), but over the past three months, Nvidia has tread water, down roughly 4%.\\n\\nA number of factors have weighed on the stock. Fears regarding a potential slowdown in the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI), rumors about a delayed release of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell platform, concerns about a decline in the company's gross margin, and a pricey valuation have some investors fearing the stock may have gotten ahead of itself.\\n\\nHowever, a quick look at the available evidence suggests that while those concerns are understandable, they are also largely unfounded. I believe there's still plenty of room for Nvidia to run, and I predict the stock will continue to reach new all-time highs into 2025. Here's why.\\n\\nThe accelerating adoption of AI has helped fuel the run-up in technology stocks since the start of 2023, but investors have begun to wonder if that breakneck pace could continue. There's evidence that suggests it can.\\n\\nTo close out the calendar second quarter, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms all announced plans to increase capital expenditures (capex) for the remainder of 2024, while also laying out plans for significant increases next year. The vast majority of that spending will be allocated to outfitting the servers and data centers needed to support AI. Since these tech titans are Nvidia's biggest customers, this suggests the company's growth streak has legs.\\n\\nTaking a step back and looking at the big picture can also provide context. Generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy in the coming years, according to estimates provided by management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. This suggests that the adoption of AI will continue for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nBlackwell is on track\\n\\nReports emerged in early August that Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips would be delayed by as much as three months due to production issues. The stock skidded on these reports as investors feared the worst.\\n\\nWhen Nvidia released its quarterly results in late August, CFO Colette Kress put the matter to rest:\\n\\nWe shipped customer samples of our Blackwell architecture in the second quarter. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue.\\n\\nThis suggests the reported delays were much ado about nothing.\\n\\nFears regarding slowing growth are myopic\\n\\nWhen Nvidia reported the results of its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), there was much to like. The company generated record quarterly revenue, record quarterly data center revenue, and robust profits. However, there were two issues investors seemed to focus on in Nvidia's otherwise stellar results.\\n\\nThe first was the company's gross margin, which declined from a record 78.4% in Q1 to 75.1% in Q2. During the earnings conference call, CFO Colette Kress noted that a combination of product mix and inventory provisions related to the rollout of Blackwell were the culprits.\\n\\nThat said, the company is forecasting gross margins for the remainder of the year in the mid-70% range. While that's below the record results in the first quarter, it's still well ahead of Nvidia's 10-year average gross margin of 62%.\\n\\nData by YCharts\\n\\nThe other issue that seemed to spook some investors was Nvidia's forecast for its fiscal third quarter, which ends in late October. The company is guiding for record revenue of $32.5 billion, which would represent growth of 79%. That would mark a deceleration from the triple-digit growth Nvidia has delivered in each of the previous five quarters, but it's still a remarkable performance nonetheless.\\n\\nSavvy investors knew that the company's growth rate would eventually slow, particularly as Nvidia faces tough comps from last year. That said, the company's revenue growth is still exceptional and should be viewed in that context.\\n\\nNot as pricey as you might think\\n\\nOne of the biggest issues weighing on Nvidia is the notion that the stock is exorbitantly expensive. That view is certainly understandable, given that the stock is currently selling for 57 times earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of 30 for the S&P 500. However, investors willing to take a step back will see that Nvidia isn't as expensive as it might appear at first glance.\\n\\nA quick look at the stock chart reveals that Nvidia is actually trading slightly lower than its average P/E ratio over the past decade. It's also worth noting that during the past 10 years, Nvidia stock has gained more than 25,000%, evidence that the stock has been -- and continues to be -- deserving of a premium.\\n\\nData by YCharts\\n\\nHowever, a look ahead suggests the stock is even cheaper. Wall Street is forecasting earnings per share of $4.02 for the coming fiscal year, which kicks off in late January. That means Nvidia is currently trading for less than 29 times forward earnings (as of this writing), which is a bargain, particularly given the company's continuing growth prospects.\\n\\nAn objective view\\n\\nGiven the run-up of Nvidia stock since early last year, it's understandable that investors are taking a step back to survey the landscape. Yet it's clear the factors that have been weighing on the stock are much ado about nothing.\\n\\nNvidia's largest customers continue to spend heavily on its products, its next-generation platform is on track, its gross margin remains near a record high, and its valuation isn't nearly as pricey as it appears at first glance.\\n\\nThis all suggests a clear runway ahead for Nvidia, and I predict that the stock will continue to reach new heights well into 2025.\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\\n\\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $743,952!*\\n\\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The Fed Funds rate was lowered by 50 basis points, pulling most other interest rates lower with it. The Fed committee responsible for such decisions also suggests more rate cuts are in the near-term cards, which should stimulate the economy without reigniting inflation. That's why investors are celebrating the move, and the rhetoric.\\n\\nNot every company is better off with lower interest rates in this particular economic environment, however. Brokerage firm Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW) arguably has more to lose than gain for the foreseeable future. Investors would be wise to keep their expectations in check. Here's why.\\n\\nSchwab's top moneymaker is pressured, and will be for a while\\n\\nYou know Charles Schwab as a leading online broker, but trading doesn't actually drive most of its revenue. Neither does investment management or retirement plan administration. Ditto for its banking business. Rather, Schwab's single biggest source of revenue is interest income, accounting for nearly half of the company's top line. And that's after paying its own interest expenses on this revenue, to be clear.\\n\\nSurprised? Plenty of people are, given the nature of its business. Moreover, it's a cyclical problem that could persist for a while.\\n\\nCharles Schwab makes more net interest income when rates are higher than it does when they're lower, since the spreads -- the difference between interest earned and interest paid -- are higher when rates are elevated.\\n\\nWe're already seeing this phenomenon, in fact, but this pressure on profitability is also just getting started if more interest rate cuts are in store.\\n\\nThe image below tells part of the tale, comparing Schwab's interest revenue to its interest expense to determine its net interest revenue. As you can see, net interest revenue peaked in late 2022, even before interest rates themselves did. As you can also see, Schwab's net interest revenue has continued to dwindle, while overall interest rates have flattened, if not fallen themselves. Most alarming, however, is that market-based interest rates were already falling before Wednesday's decision. They're apt to continue falling too, as the Federal Reserve suggests that is in the cards.\\n\\nData source: Charles Schwab Corp. Chart by author. Dollar figures are in millions.\\n\\nHere's why it matters: As of the second quarter of this year, 46% of Schwab's total revenue is net interest revenue driven by offerings such as margin loans, cash holdings (including money market funds), and the like. That quarter's net interest revenue of $2.16 billion is almost 30% below Q2 2022's figure of over $3 billion, when this source of revenue accounted for over half of Schwab's top line.\\n\\nData source: Charles Schwab Corp. Chart by author. Figures are in millions.\\n\\nThis number is almost certainly going to get smaller going forward, as interest rates continue to fall. It's already happening, in fact. Although margin loan balances are up since then, Schwab's average level of interest earnings assets is near the first quarter's multi-year low, which is more than 16% below 2023's peak.\\n\\nImage source: Charles Schwab Corp. Q2 2024 udpate.\\n\\nIn other words, Schwab's clients are currently holding relatively few investments that generate cash flow for the broker. They're holding more stocks and bonds, which (at best) only generate one commission charge or bid/ask spread-based gain at that trade's entry.\\n\\nRight stock, wrong time\\n\\nIt's not all bad. At the very least, Schwab is winning new customers, and gathering more money as a result. As of the end of August, it was holding a stunning $9.74 trillion worth of client assets, up 20% year over year. Even if only a relatively small portion of these holdings generate recurring revenue, these holdings are still being held by the broker. It will be able to monetize them when the time is right.\\n\\nThe current economic backdrop isn't one that favors Schwab, however, or any other broker for that matter.\\n\\nEven if borrowing costs are coming down, money is still tight thanks to inflation... one of the reasons corporate bankruptcies are now above pre-pandemic levels. There's not a lot of must-have stock trading activity waiting in the wings either, with the overall economy set to be merely ho-hum for a while as the post-pandemic effects wind down. New investor money inflows are likely to slow going forward as growth stocks continue cooling off. Schwab's top and bottom lines are apt to reflect this slowdown.\\n\\nBottom line? Schwab's still a solid long-term holding. The near term doesn't look so bright, though. Less patient investors might want to consider other, more promising options in the meantime.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Charles Schwab right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Charles Schwab, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Charles Schwab wasn't one of them.
